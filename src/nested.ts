const deepCopy = ghibliMovies.map((movie: Movie): Movie => ({ ...movie })); neeed parenthesis wrapping {} to say ur making a new obj not functon and return as the onj

heres an ex of this implemented in

const myCityRestaursnts = restaurants.map(r => ){

return {..r, menu: r.menu.map(menutItem:):  => ({...menuItem})}
}
or const newMenu = r.menu.map(menuItem) => ({...menuItem})
and return {..r, newMenu}
main idea; 
if ur copying over nested data and want to update  field u need to map through the field and apply a deep copy
This makes a new array of each object in that field and
